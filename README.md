- **Worldwide Gross**: Total global earnings.

## Data Cleaning

Key steps in data cleaning included:
1. Converting dates to datetime format.
2. Standardizing currency values to USD.
3. Handling missing values and ensuring correct data types.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA included:
- Visualization of rating distributions.
